**Working backwards, Part II.** (5.24, p. 203) A 90% confidence interval for a population mean is (65, 77). The population distribution is approximately normal and the population standard deviation is unknown. This confidence interval is based on a simple random sample of 25 observations. Calculate the sample mean, the margin of error, and the sample standard deviation.

**SAT scores.** (7.14, p. 261) SAT scores of students at an Ivy League college are distributed with a standard deviation of 250 points. Two statistics students, Raina and Luke, want to estimate the average SAT score of students at this college as part of a class project. They want their margin of error to be no more than 25 points.

(a) Raina wants to use a 90% confidence interval. How large a sample should she collect?
(b) Luke wants to use a 99% confidence interval. Without calculating the actual sample size, determine whether his sample should be larger or smaller than Rainaâ€™s, and explain your reasoning.
(c) Calculate the minimum required sample size for Luke.

**High School and Beyond, Part I.** (7.20, p. 266) The National Center of Education Statistics conducted a survey of high school seniors, collecting test data on reading, writing, and several other subjects. Here we examine a simple random sample of 200 students from this survey. Side-by-side box plots of reading and writing scores as well as a histogram of the differences in scores are shown below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.height=3}
library(openintro)
data(hsb2)
scores <- c(hsb2$read, hsb2$write)
gp <- c(rep('read', nrow(hsb2)), rep('write', nrow(hsb2)))
par(mar = c(3, 4, 0.5, 0.5), las = 1, mgp = c(2.8, 0.7, 0), 
    cex.axis = 1.1, cex.lab = 1.1)
openintro::dotPlot(scores, gp, vertical = TRUE, ylab = "scores", 
                   at=1:2+0.13, col = COL[1,3], 
                   xlim = c(0.5,2.5), ylim = c(20, 80), 
                   axes = FALSE, cex.lab = 1.25, cex.axis = 1.25)
axis(1, at = c(1,2), labels = c("read","write"), cex.lab = 1.25, cex.axis = 1.25)
axis(2, at = seq(20, 80, 20), cex.axis = 1.25)
boxplot(scores ~ gp, add = TRUE, axes = FALSE, col = NA)

par(mar=c(3.3, 2, 0.5, 0.5), las = 1, mgp = c(2.1, 0.7, 0), 
    cex.lab = 1.25, cex.axis = 1.25)
histPlot(hsb2$read - hsb2$write, col = COL[1], 
         xlab = "Differences in scores (read - write)", ylab = "")
```

(a) Is there a clear difference in the average reading and writing scores?
(b) Are the reading and writing scores of each student independent of each other?
(c) Create hypotheses appropriate for the following research question: is there an evident difference in the average scores of students in the reading and writing exam?
(d) Check the conditions required to complete this test.
(e) The average observed difference in scores is ${ \widehat { x }  }_{ read-write }=-0.545$, and the standard deviation of the differences is 8.887 points. Do these data provide convincing evidence of a difference between the average scores on the two exams?
(f) What type of error might we have made? Explain what the error means in the context of the application.
(g) Based on the results of this hypothesis test, would you expect a confidence interval for the average difference between the reading and writing scores to include 0? Explain your reasoning.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r problem720}
## Student response to problem 7.20

##  (a) No, there is not a clear difference between scores. There is an
##      observable difference but it is not clear if it is meaningful.

##  (b) NO, although the scores are from seperate tests they are for the same students.

##  (c) H0: The difference in average scores between reading and writing is 0.
##      HA: The difference in average scores between reading and writing is not 0.

##  (d) condition1: independence: No. Therefore use paired analysis.
##      condition2: sample size >= 30: yes; this sample has 200 cases
        nrow(hsb2)


##  (e) No, these do no provide convincing evidence of a difference betweeen
##      average scores. The given the parameters of this distribution it would result
##      in a p-value of 0.39, which is greater than 0.05. Thus we would fail to reject
##      the null hypothesis.
        2*pnorm(-0.545, mean = 0, sd = 8.887/sqrt(nrow(hsb2)))

##  (f) We could be making a Type II error. Failing to reject the null hypothesis (H0)
##      when there may be a real difference between reading and writing scores.
##
##  (g) Yes, based on this sample and the resulting hypothesis test, it would be
##      expected that a confidence interval would include 0. The p-value was below the
##      critical value by a large degree. Thus is would be expected that 0 would be
##      well within the confidence interval.

**Fuel efficiency of manual and automatic cars, Part II.** (7.28, p. 276) The table provides summary statistics on highway fuel economy of cars manufactured in 2012.

**Email outreach efforts.** (7.34, p. 284) A medical research group is recruiting people to complete short surveys about their medical history. For example, one survey asks for information on a personâ€™s family history in regards to cancer. Another survey asks about what topics were discussed during the personâ€™s last visit to a hospital. So far, as people sign up, they complete an average of just 4 surveys, and the standard deviation of the number of surveys is about 2.2. The research group wants to try a new interface that they think will encourage new enrollees to complete more surveys, where they will randomize each enrollee to either get the new interface or the current interface. How many new enrollees do they need for each interface to detect an effect size of 0.5 surveys per enrollee, if the desired power level is 80%?
